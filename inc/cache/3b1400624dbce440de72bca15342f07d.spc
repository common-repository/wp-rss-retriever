We&#8217;ll cover artboards, canvases, backgrounds, and the basics of vector drawing.</h2>
<p>Vector drawing in Illustrator might come easy to a few, but for many it&#8217;s an alien process and a complicated tool. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be. If you start with the basics, you can build a solid foundation in vector illustration.</p>
<p>For this article, we found some of the most frequently asked questions about Illustrator and answered them with simple explanations. In part one of this two-part series, we will cover artboard and canvas sizes, backgrounds, vector shapes, and color application.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Artboard and Canvas Size</h3>
<p>Creating a new document is the first step of your Illustrator journey. Open Adobe Illustrator, then hold down <strong>Command + N</strong> to bring up the <strong>New Document</strong> window. This popup menu is where you can name your new document, set height and width dimensions, define measurements, and more.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106230 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – New Document" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/Canvas-Size-1.jpg" alt="Illustrator new document panel" width="1024" height="638" /></p>
<p>You can choose from a variety of preset sizes within the Mobile, Web, Print, and Film &amp; Video tabs, or you can simply input your own values. When finished, hit <strong>Create</strong> to go to the Illustrator program.</p>
<h4>How do I change artboard size in Illustrator?</h4>
<p>To change the dimensions of the artboard you&#8217;re currently using, head to the <strong>Artboard Tool</strong> (hit the <strong>Shift + O</strong> keys) and drag the corner handles to resize. When this tool is activated, you can also organize and move individual artboards for easy access.</p>
<p>To add a new artboard to the main screen, open the <strong>Artboards</strong> panel (<strong>Window &gt;Artboards</strong>) and select the <strong>folded square icon</strong> at the bottom right. In this panel you can also click on the dropdown menu in the top right corner to find options for duplicating an artboard and changing the orientation.</p>
<h4>How do I change canvas size in illustrator?</h4>
<p><em>Note: In Illustrator, the workspace that you usually call a canvas is the called an artboard. Artboards work in virtually the same way as a canvas – the different is that you can work across multiple artboards in a single file.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106232 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – New Document – Artboard Size" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/Canvas-Size-2a.jpg" alt="Changing artboard size in Illustrator" width="1024" height="583" /></p>
<p>To change the canvas (aka artboard) size, you can quickly tweak the dimensions by opening the <strong>Artboards</strong> panel (<strong>Window &gt;Artboards</strong>), then clicking on the <strong>canvas square icon</strong> next to the artboard name. This brings up an <strong>Artboard Options</strong> menu where you can change both the width and height dimensions or change the artboard name as needed. Hit <strong>OK</strong> to return back to the main screen.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Background Basics</h3>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve set up your document and created a custom artboard, let&#8217;s go over the basics of backgrounds.</p>
<h4>How do I change the background color in Illustrator?</h4>
<p>To change the canvas/artboard background color, activate the <strong>Rectangle Tool (M)</strong> and draw a rectangle the size of your artboard. There are two techniques for creating a rectangle background:</p>
<ol>
<li>Activate the <strong>Rectangle Tool (M) </strong>and click and drag the cursor across the artboard. Resize the rectangle as necessary</li>
<li>Activate the <strong>Rectangle Tool (M)</strong> and right click on the canvas to pull up the <strong>Rectangle</strong> menu. Enter the dimensions of your artboard, then hit <strong>OK</strong>. Move the rectangle shape on top of the artboard using the <strong>Selection Tool (V)</strong> to act as your background.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106331 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – Background Color" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/FAQ-BG-Color-1.gif" alt="Adding background color in Illustrator" width="1024" height="587" /></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve created your background shape, pull up the <strong>Color</strong> or <strong>Swatches</strong> menu. If you can&#8217;t see these menus in your workspace, head up to the <strong>Window</strong> toolbar and activate them.</p>
<p>By default, Illustrator creates your first shape as a black outline with white fill. To change the fill color, click the solid box and use the slider or swatches to select the color. To delete the outline around the box, select the stroke color box (it looks like a frame), then select the white box with the red slash running through it – this means &#8220;empty.&#8221; The fill and stroke colors are always previewed on the lefthand side of the program for easy reference.</p>
<p><em>Learn more about color in Illustrator below.</em></p>
<h4>How do I remove the background in Illustrator?</h4>
<p>To remove the colored background, simply activate the background shape with the <strong>Selection Tool (V)</strong> and hit the <strong>Delete</strong> or the <strong>/</strong> key. Using the delete button removes the shape entirely, while using the forward slash button only removes the fill color, while keeping whatever stroke you have applied.</p>
<h4>How do I make the background transparent in Illustrator?</h4>
<p><em>Note: In illustrator, vectors automatically have a &#8220;transparent&#8221; background. Since shapes, lines, and drawings are saved as components, there&#8217;s no background element unless you add a colored box around your image. It&#8217;s almost as if your drawings are &#8220;floating&#8221; on the artboard.</em></p>
<p>Adobe Illustrator defaults to a white workspace for each artboard or canvas. Having a white background can be confusing for some when working in the program. To change the white background to a transparent checkerboard background, head up to the top toolbar and go to <strong>View &gt; Show Transparency Grid</strong>. This same technique can be accessed by hitting <strong>Shift + Command + D</strong>.</p>
<p>However, transparency does come into play if you want to save your vector as a <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/raster-vs-vector-file-formats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raster file</a> so that you can upload it to the web or use it in apps that can&#8217;t read vectors. In this case, click <strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Export as</strong> and choose to save your file as PNG. (PNGs are the most basic raster file type that allows for transparency.) <strong>Hit Export</strong>. In the <strong>PNG Options</strong> window that appears, set the <strong>Background Color</strong> to <strong>Transparent</strong>. Make sure you have deleted any colored background that you&#8217;ve added to the canvas before you do this.</p>

<h3>Vector Shapes</h3>
<p>Shapes are essential to vector drawing; they form the foundation of patterns, characters, objects, and more. In vector drawing, the lines and curves that make a shape are called paths. Learning how to create basic and complex paths is a crucial skillset for new digital artists.</p>
<p>There are two ways to create vector shapes in Illustrator: with the <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/pen-tool-guide-illustrator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pen Tool</a> or a <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/revealing-secrets-shapes-tool-illustrator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shapes Tool</a>. The Pen Tool comes in handy if you&#8217;re creating complex shapes like a mountaintop or a silhouette, while the Shapes Tool is useful when creating basic shapes, i.e. rectangles and circles.</p>
<h4><strong>Using the Pen Tool</strong></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/pen-tool-guide-illustrator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pen Tool</a> is the most important tool in Illustrator. With it, you can create the simple and complex shapes, lines, and curves that will ultimately become a drawing, logo, pattern, and more.</p>
<p>To begin, let&#8217;s create an irregular shape with the Pen Tool. Activate the tool by hitting <strong>P</strong> on the keyboard or by selecting the <strong>pen tip icon</strong> on the left toolbar. Click on the artboard to lay down the initial anchor point, then click around to continue your path. The more anchor points you set down, the more angles your shape will have. Close up the path by clicking on the initial anchor point. A circle will appear next to the pen cursor when the shape is closed.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106355 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – Pen Tool" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/FAQ-Pen-Tool-1a.gif" alt="creating a shape with the pen tool in illustrator" width="1024" height="597" /></p>
<p>Even though you&#8217;ve closed the path, you can still make adjustments to each anchor point. Activate the <strong>Direct Selection Tool (A) </strong>and click on an individual point and drag it around. Add more anchor points with the <strong>Add Anchor Point Tool (+)</strong> or delete existing anchor points with the <strong>Delete Anchor Point Tool (-)</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106357 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – Curving Paths" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/FAQ-Pen-Tool-2a.gif" alt="curving paths in Illustrator" width="1024" height="597" /></p>
<p>To curve the paths of your shape, activate the <strong>Anchor Point Tool (Shift + C) </strong>and drag the line path in any direction.</p>

<h4><strong>Using the Shapes Tool</strong></h4>
<p>The Shapes Tool is a designer go-to for both quick shapes and complex polygons. You can access all of the shape tools from the <strong>Rectangle Tool (M)</strong> dropdown arrow; hold down the cursor on the rectangle icon to bring up the <strong>Ellipse Tool (L)</strong>, <strong>Polygon Tool</strong>, and others.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106332 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – Shapes Tool" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/FAQ-Shapes-Tool.gif" alt="shapes tool illustrator" width="1024" height="591" /></p>
<p>To create your shape, click and drag the cursor across the artboard. Hold down the <strong>Shift key</strong> to constrain the shape&#8217;s proportions and make a perfect circle or square. Use the <strong>Polygon Tool</strong> for shapes that have more than four sides. Click on the artboard to bring up the Polygon menu, then enter in the values for the radius and number of sides.</p>
<h4>How do I add rounded corners in Illustrator?</h4>
<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t want sharp, pointy corners in your design. Rounded corners adds a smooth and fluid quality that sharp corners lack.</p>
<p>Start off by creating a vector shape with one of the <strong>Shapes Tools</strong> mentioned above. Activate the vector shape with the <strong>Selection Tool (V)</strong> to see the shape highlighted. Within each corner, you&#8217;ll notice small circles; these handles can be pulled inwards to round out those corners. Pull the handles back out to reduce the roundedness.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106335 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – Rounded Corners" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/Live-Corners-1.gif" alt="Rounded corner illustrator" width="1024" height="597" /></p>
<p>Sometimes you just want to manipulate a single corner instead of all of them. To do so, activate the <strong>Direct Selection Tool (A)</strong> and click on an individual corner. A circle will appear within the selected corner. Drag the cursor inwards to round out the corner. This technique also works when rounding the corners in a complex shape created with the <strong>Pen Tool (P)</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106336 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – Rounding One Corner" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/FAQ-Live-Corners-2a.gif" alt="Rounding one corner of a shape in Illustrator" width="1024" height="594" /></p>

<h3>Color &amp; Stroke</h3>
<p>Color is a vital component of illustration and graphic design; it sets the tone and mood of a composition with the help of <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/complete-guide-color-in-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psychology</a>. Color psychology focuses on <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/colors-and-moods-communication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">color symbolism and meaning</a> and how colors and their combinations impact human emotions. Each hue involved evokes a specific emotional responses from viewers, shaping how that they perceive the overall design. Learning how to apply color intentionally and thoughtfully is a necessary skillset for any illustrator, no matter the expertise.</p>
<h4>How do I color in Illustrator?</h4>
<p>Manipulate the color of your image by changing the stroke and fill. You can only add or change color on a vector object, whether it be a line, text path, or shape. Draw out a shape or line with the the <strong>Pen</strong> or <strong>Shapes Tool</strong> mentioned above or use the <strong>Text Tool</strong>, mentioned below, to type out a phrase.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106568 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – Color Fill" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/FAQ-Color-Fill.jpg" alt="Color in shapes in Illustrator" width="1024" height="598" /></p>
<p>Illustrator has two menus that work for applying color: the <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/swatches-panel-guide-design-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Swatches</strong></a> and the <strong>Color</strong> panels. Add color in the Swatches panel by clicking on a swatch square, or look through default swatches by clicking the dropdown menu and selecting <strong>Open Swatch Library</strong>. In the <strong>Color</strong> panel, you can adjust the color values by moving the RGB sliders or by dragging your cursor around the color range.</p>
<h4>How do I add an outline stroke in Illustrator?</h4>
<p>Adding a stroke to any shape requires the same technique as adding a color fill. With the <strong>Selection Tool (V)</strong>, click on a vector object and hit <strong>X</strong> to enable the stroke option.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106558 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – Outline Stroke" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/FAQ-Stroke1.jpg" alt="Change stroke color in illustrator" width="1024" height="596" /></p>
<p>Use the <strong>Swatches</strong> or <strong>Color</strong> menus to add or change the color, then adjust the stroke weight with the <strong>Stroke</strong> panel.</p>
<h4>How do I make a gradient in Illustrator?</h4>
<p>Start by creating a vector shape. Then open up the <strong>Gradient</strong> panel; if it&#8217;s not active, navigate to <strong>Window &gt; Gradient</strong>. Select the vector object and click on a gradient type, either Linear, Radial, or <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/illustrator-freeform-gradient-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freeform</a>. By default, Illustrator will create a white to black gradient fill.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106557 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – Gradient Fill" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/FAQ-Gradient-Tool.jpg" alt="Add gradient fill in Illustrator" width="1024" height="596" /></p>
<p>You can adjust the appearance of the gradient in many ways: with custom swatches, gradient stop locations, specific angles, and more. Drag a swatch from the <strong>Swatches</strong> panel onto a gradient stop to change its color, and move the gradient stop&#8217;s location to modify the gradient transition.</p>

<h4>How do I change the color of an image in Illustrator?</h4>
<p>In a simple composition with a few shapes and paths, you just need to use the <strong>Selection Tool (V)</strong> to click on a vector shape; head to the <strong>Color</strong> or <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/swatches-panel-guide-design-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Swatches</strong></a> panels and select a swatch or manipulate the <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/rgb-vs-cmyk-color-modes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RGB</a> sliders.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106548"  class="wp-caption alignnone  entry__figure entry__figure--size-full&quot;"><img class="wp-image-106548 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – Select by Color" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/FAQ-Color-Change.gif" alt="Select by color in illustrator" width="1024" height="597" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em>Image via <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/retro-abstract-pattern-geometric-style-classic-526862749?src=u-MuqAY7SISuYgLQ1d4bhA-1-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alternative Geometry</a>.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For more detailed compositions, I prefer to use the <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/select-by-color-adobe-illustrator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Select by Color</strong> technique</a>. Instead of clicking around each individual shape on the artboard, you can take a shortcut by selecting by fill color. Select a vector object, then go to <strong>Select &gt; Same &gt; Fill Color</strong>. Every vector shape with the same color will be selected, giving you the ability to change the colors of multiple objects in one click.</p>
<h4>How do I erase in Illustrator?</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106546 size-full" title="Illustrator FAQ: The Total Beginner's Guide to Vector Illustration, Pt. 1 – Erase" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/FAQ-Eraser.gif" alt="How to erase in illustrator" width="1024" height="596" /></p>
<p>Erasing away vector shapes is great when you need to make small changes to your image. Activate the <strong>Eraser Tool (Shift + E)</strong>, select a vector object, and click and drag across the shape. To adjust the size of the eraser cursor, toggle the <strong>[ key</strong> to decrease and the <strong>] key</strong> to increase.</p>

<p><strong>What’s on your dream list of photography books to read</strong>? For travel photographers, maybe it’s the diary of an explorer venturing into the unknown. For food photographers, maybe it’s a recently released cookbook with inspiring imagery from local photographers. Whatever it is, this is the ultimate list of photography books to read to get inspired to create better art.</p>
<p>We get it. Opening a browser and searching for inspiration is a lot easier (and perhaps cheaper) nowadays. However, there’s something about having a physical reference art book that seems to resonate more than any blog or social media platform ever could.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/g/NicoleGlass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Glass​</a> uploaded her first YouTube video about stock photography on a whim. She’d been a Shutterstock Contributor for about a year, and she wanted to reflect on what she’d learned. What she didn’t expect was the number of views. “To my surprise, the video really took off,” she admits. “The comment section was filled with questions from people who wanted to know more. I decided to make a second Shutterstock video—and that one skyrocketed as well.”</p>
<p>These days, in addition to her general photo tips and educational videos, Glass releases regular episodes about creating marketable photos, like <em>​<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igia6CC_fLk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secrets to Making Money as a Shutterstock Photographer</a></em>, which has nearly 90,000 views to date.</p>
<p>“You can succeed with stock photography in this day and age, and it is possible to make a good amount of money at it—as long as you’re consistent and strategic,” she tells us. “You just have to understand what the market wants.” We asked her to share some of the wisdom she’s gathered over the last couple of years in stock photography. Read on to learn more, and be sure to check out her ​<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo62u24M1wPmGYHIEg3gHDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>​ for yourself.</p>

<h4>When and how did you get into stock photography?</h4>
<p>“I first signed up for Shutterstock in March 2017. I was drawn in by a sense of curiosity, as I knew very little about stock photography at the time. Over the following months, I uploaded photos that I took in my city—Washington, D.C.—and was surprised to see that I was actually making money from my images, pretty much right away. I always loved searching the internet to see how my editorial images were being used, and often I’d see them end up on well-known news platforms.”</p>

<h4>How do you fit stock into your day-to-day routine, while also working on other projects?</h4>
<p>“I live in a city where there’s always something going on, whether it’s a festival, parade, protest, or other news event. If I’m available and near a newsworthy event, I’ll go out and photograph that.</p>
<p>“Since I usually carry my camera with me, I’ll also keep an eye out for stock-worthy photographs throughout my day. Sometimes that means taking illustrative editorial photos of objects; other times, it might mean using a coworker as a model during a lunch break.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-full alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/blonde-woman-field-sunflowers-looks-directly-1454733440?src=6lhki-PUpsIFOSkpCu5BNA-1-52&amp;studio=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-106294 size-full" title="YouTube Sensation Nicole Glass Shares Her Stock Photo Secrets — Sunflower" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/2-4.jpg" alt="YouTube Sensation Nicole Glass Shares Her Stock Photo Secrets — Sunflower" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>
<p><em>Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/g/NicoleGlass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole S Glass</a></em></p>
<p>“If I’m hired for a shoot, I might spend a few extra minutes before or after the shoot to take some additional photos for stock. In the case of the photo below, for example, I was hired to photograph a corporate event, but I took a few additional concept photos for stock after the event:</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-full alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/woman-holds-glass-wine-corporate-networking-1048030033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-106295 size-full" title="YouTube Sensation Nicole Glass Shares Her Stock Photo Secrets — Conference" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/3-4.jpg" alt="YouTube Sensation Nicole Glass Shares Her Stock Photo Secrets — Conference" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>
<p><em>Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/g/NicoleGlass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole S Glass</a></em></p>
<p>“Once I’ve got my photos ready, I’ll save them and add the keywords and captions during my lunch break or in between other projects that I have. That way, stock photography is a fun addition to my daily life, but it’s never overwhelming. The number of photos I upload varies, but lately, it’s been a few hundred per month.”</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-full alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/washington-dc-usa-june-8-2019-1419999281?src=N%20ZCM7KflkL7mqdJzA0pjoA-1-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-106297 size-large" title="YouTube Sensation Nicole Glass Shares Her Stock Photo Secrets — Pride D.C." src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/4-4.jpg?w=750" alt="YouTube Sensation Nicole Glass Shares Her Stock Photo Secrets — Pride D.C." width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>

<h4>What separates a great photographer from a great ​<em>stock </em>photographer? Aside from excellent photography skills, what characteristics do all bestselling stock photographers seem to share?</h4>
<p>“Not all stock photographers are the same. Some focus on commercial photoshoots and spend a lot of time hiring models and setting up shots. Others, like myself, spend more time gathering newsworthy editorial content. There’s a market for both of them.</p>
<p>“But the photographers who do well all have one thing in common: they fill in the gaps and create photos with a new, fresh perspective to add to the platform. Being a talented photographer does not necessarily make you a good stock photographer. What makes you a good stock photographer is being able to understand what potential clients could be searching for, how you can provide that, and how you can optimize your images so that they can be discovered.”</p>

<h4>What’s the number one thing you wish you’d known before getting started on Shutterstock?</h4>
<p>“I wish I had spent more time filling up the keywords sections with fifty good keywords. In the beginning, I didn’t quite realize how important keywords are. The more quality keywords you have, the higher the chances of your content being discovered.”</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-full alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/washington-dc-april-29-2017-thousands-630429824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-106299 size-large" title="YouTube Sensation Nicole Glass Shares Her Stock Photo Secrets — Newsworthy Causes" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/6-4.jpg?w=750" alt="YouTube Sensation Nicole Glass Shares Her Stock Photo Secrets — Newsworthy Causes" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>

<h4>Tell us about a photo of yours that gets downloaded over and over again. Why do you think this photo appeals to buyers, and more specifically, why do you think this photo has longevity?</h4>
<p>“Currently, my #1 top-selling image is a photo I took of the Climate March in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 2017. Climate change is a hot topic and it keeps getting hotter (literally). I noticed that this image was downloaded at an even higher frequency during the heatwave we experienced on the East Coast recently.</p>
<p>“I suspect this photo will continue to be relevant as long as climate change is an issue. Even though this is an editorial photo from two years ago, the topic itself continues to be newsworthy. The fact that the Capitol building is in the background also adds that political aspect to the image.”</p>
<h4>We love your ​<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uumU_u0R6c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video about “weird” sales</a>​! What’s your number one weirdest download, and why do you think it sold?</h4>
<p>“Anyone who’s watched my videos probably knows this already, and I still feel embarrassed about it. My ‘weirdest’ download was a $101 sale of a photo of my toe with a corn on it from wearing heels for too long. I’d prefer if you don’t embed that image into this post but leave it up to the reader’s imagination instead! Overall, photos of injuries or weird bodily traits have done relatively well for me. I suspect there’s a need for them among medical journals and publications.”</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-full alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/washington-dc-usa-june-8-2019-1420005542?src=N%20ZCM7KflkL7mqdJzA0pjoA-1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-106300 size-large" title="YouTube Sensation Nicole Glass Shares Her Stock Photo Secrets — Pride Parade" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/7-4.jpg?w=750" alt="YouTube Sensation Nicole Glass Shares Her Stock Photo Secrets — Pride Parade" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>
<p><em>Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/g/NicoleGlass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole S Glass</a></em></p>
<h4>When you upload your images now, do you have a pretty good idea of which ones will sell and which ones won’t? Are there any tell-tale traits that all your bestsellers seem to share?</h4>
<p>“I do have a pretty good idea of what might do well. For example, I recently photographed the Capital Pride Parade in Washington, D.C., and I noticed that there were very few images of the Washington, D.C. parade on Shutterstock. At the same time, June was Pride Month, so this was a trending topic. And as I suspected, my photos of the Pride Parade did quite well—and still do well. Overall, my best sellers are either newsworthy images or images with unique perspectives that are harder to get, like drone shots.”</p>

<h4>How has video/footage changed the game for you?</h4>
<p>“Although less than 10% of my content is video, more than 50% of my earnings typically come from video sales. This year, I’ve decided to focus more on footage uploads because the payout is much more rewarding. Most cameras record video, so if you’re out taking photos, it might be worth it for you to record a few clips as well. And if you can, record them in 4K, since that will make your footage even more valuable. Video is not the future—it is the present, and I believe it is much easier to become a full-time stock videographer than a stock photographer.”</p>

<h4>What advice would you give to emerging stock photographers?</h4>
<p>“A lot of people ask me about why they’re not making many sales with their own personal stock portfolios. While there could be a number of reasons for this, most of the time I notice that these individuals are uploading photos in saturated topics: trees, leaves, flowers, cats, dogs, blades of grass, etc.</p>
<p>“And while their photos might be incredibly beautiful, these categories are very competitive already. In order to do well and have their photos stand out, they should try to discover what sort of photos are in-demand and less saturated on the platform they’re submitting to. So my best advice is to run some searches on Shutterstock.com to see what’s out there and what you can add that’s unique.”</p>

<p>Film School will tell you if you want to make a movie, you need a gaffer, a grip, 1st AC, 2nd AC, director of photography, 1st AD, 2nd AD, Best boy grip, best boy gaff, makeup artist, PAs, DIT, sound engineer, boom op, stunts, choreography . . . <em>but . . .</em> you don’t.</p>
<p>You can get by with 20 people, or you can get by with five people. But, who are those five people? What are their roles? And is it possible to get the same quality in your final product with a five-person crew as you would with a 20? Yes. But, it takes a lot of planning and some really talented folks.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;re going to answer the age-old question: <em>How many people do you really need on set?</em></p>

<h3>The Traditional Film Set Hierarchy</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106692" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/crew-list.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="541" /></p>
<p>So before we start, let’s take a crash course on the hierarchy of the traditional film crew. First, we’ve got the director, who is the creative mastermind behind the film. This is a &#8220;big picture&#8221; person. To get all of the day-to-day stuff done like organizing actors, staying on time, and relaying info from the director, you need a 1st assistant director. If your project gets bigger and needs more logistical help, you might hire a 2nd AD or even a second 2nd AD. In that same category would be your script supervisor, who makes sure that the actors cover every line and then maintains continuity.</p>
<p>Then you’ve got your Camera Department. The head is the director of photography, who is in charge of capturing the director&#8217;s vision with the camera. Under them is the 1st assistant camera. They help the DP by swapping lenses, taking care of the camera sensors, and pulling focus. Just like ADs, you’ll get 2nd ACs and second 2nd ACs the bigger your project gets. DITs, or digital imaging technicians, compile all of the footage on hard drives and organize it for the post-production team.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106695 size-full" title="How Many People Do You (Really) Need On a Film or Video Set? — Camera Man" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/camera-man.jpg" alt="How Many People Do You (Really) Need On a Film or Video Set? — Camera Man" width="1024" height="564" /></p>
<p>Next is the Grip and Gaff Department. The gaffer controls all aspects of lighting on set and ensures electrical safety. The key grip is in charge of setting up all of the major rigs on set, such as dollies, cranes, and specialized set pieces. Under them are the Best Boys — or their second in command.</p>
<p>In the audio department, You’ve got the sound engineer, who is in control of capturing all on set audio. That sound engineer will have a boom operator who holds the boom mic while the sound engineer rides the gain knobs to adjust for changing volume levels on set.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the roles, there are endless positions depending on your set. Production assistants, hair and makeup, set designer, Art Department, stunt coordinator, choreographer, VFX supervisor, animal wrangler — the list goes on.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Working with a Leaner Crew</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106696 size-full" title="How Many People Do You (Really) Need On a Film or Video Set? — Small Film Crew" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/small-film-crew.jpg" alt="How Many People Do You (Really) Need On a Film or Video Set? — Small Film Crew" width="1024" height="563" /></p>
<p>So right now, we are sitting at just around 20 people on your set at one time. This is a crew that can get just about anything you need done: action sequences, big crowd scenes, huge set pieces, and well-orchestrated shots. But, let’s be realistic. Not everyone’s going to have the budget for this kind of crew. By not everyone, I mean like 90 percent of filmmakers. So unless you’ve got the power to get people to work for free, let’s start trimming the fat.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’ve got a short film you&#8217;re ready to shoot, and you’ve got a little bit of a budget to work with. You, the writer of the short, are going to be the director. Along with you as the director, you will have a 1st AD who will act as your set coordinator and script supervisor. Your camera department is going to Be condensed down to a DP, who will also be the camera operator. Your sound department is going to combine the sound engineer position with the boom operator, and they will run boom along with controlling the knobs on a handheld/hipside recording device. Your grip and gaff department now becomes a one-man-band, like the rest of the crew. And for good measure, we are going to include a hair and makeup artist because you want your actors to look nice and pretty.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106697 size-full" title="How Many People Do You (Really) Need On a Film or Video Set? — Makeup" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/film-makeup.jpg" alt="How Many People Do You (Really) Need On a Film or Video Set? — Makeup" width="1024" height="561" /></p>
<p>So you have successfully condensed your crew from 20 people to 6. 14 fewer people to pay! But, it’s also 14 fewer people on set to help out. Which brings me to my point about a smaller crew — you can absolutely get a lot done with one, but every crew member becomes more essential. If you lose your 1st AC, you can’t use a follow focus, and your camera equipment (like Steadicams or large-scale rigs) might be out of reach. Without a large grip and gaff crew, it’s going to be a lot harder to light large rooms, and it will slow down your setup and tear-down times on set.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Designing a Project Around a Limited Crew</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106698 size-full" title="How Many People Do You (Really) Need On a Film or Video Set? — Limited Crew" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/limited-crew.jpg" alt="How Many People Do You (Really) Need On a Film or Video Set? — Limited Crew" width="1024" height="565" /></p>
<p>So it kind of shakes out like this — if you&#8217;re working with a limited crew, limit the size of your production. Use natural light and conservative lighting set-ups; small, local sets; and character-driven stories that don’t require a studio-sized set or VFX. Everyone will wear multiple hats on set, too. Small crews are an excellent way to really get to know all the positions on set, because usually, you&#8217;ll be the one filling that role when the need arises.</p>
<p>You can even create music videos and documentaries done with 1-2 person teams. Fair warning, though: you will be doing everything on your own — setting up lights, prepping gear, talking with your talent, and any other production tasks that come up. It can be tough, but it can be done.</p>
<hr />
<h3>So, What&#8217;s the Verdict?</h3>
<p>So, back to the main question: <em>How many people do you really need on set?</em> If you have a two-actor scene that you&#8217;re shooting in your basement, you only need three or four people. If you’ve got a huge Michael Bay-style action sequence, you’ll need . . . <em>more</em>.</p>
<p>Just know your limits. Know your budget. Know what story you want to tell.</p>
<p>And that’s something that you should really think about. Your script can tell the same story as a small-budget short or large-scale project. Your crew size does not determine the quality of your film. I’ve seen horrible movies with five-minute credit rolls, and I’ve seen fantastic movies produced by a team of less than 10 people.</p>
<p>So don’t get bogged down with the idea that you need a huge crew to get your project off the ground. You can get started with any budget — you’ve just got to make sure to scale the story to the production size you can afford.</p>

Learn about the 5 must-know vintage design styles so you can lift them, twist them, and reinvent them for contemporary projects.</h2>
<p class="p1">When it comes to material goods, &#8220;vintage&#8221; means any design style that&#8217;s older than 20 years, but younger than 100 – that would make it antique. In design you can take more creative liberty with the word, but it still means an older style that developed in past eras. In this article we look at five popular vintage design styles and schools of thoughts that modern-day designers should know.</p>
<p class="p1">Rather than outright copying historic designs, the most original work makes a subtle nod to the past, blending old styles with a novel approach. From <strong>Art Nouveau</strong> to <strong>Sixties Psychedelia</strong>, these are the vintage styles designers are revisiting in 2019.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="p1">1. Art Nouveau</h3>
<p class="p1">The <strong>Art Nouveau</strong> movement was inspired by <strong>natural forms</strong>, particularly the curved lines of plants, trees and flowers. This informed an organic and dynamic design style. This highly decorative style was at its most popular between 1890 and 1910.</p>
<p class="p1">The style has been revisited periodically through the 20th and 21st centuries; its influence was particularly notable during the &#8217;60s psychedelia design phase. While Art Nouveau is known for its ornamentation, contemporary designers strip this vintage design style down to its basic elements for a  more minimal look.</p>
<p class="p1">In this example, Mexican design agency Parámetro Studio use a Nouveau-inspired typeface for the identity of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>luxury real estate developer MONAT.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone">
<p><figure id="attachment_106424"  class="wp-caption alignnone  entry__figure entry__figure--size-large&quot;"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/83229503/MONAT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-106424 size-large" title="5 Vintage Design Styles Every Designer Should Know – MONAT" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/Monat.jpg?w=750" alt="vintage design styles art nouveau" width="750" height="1050" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mexican design agency <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/83229503/MONAT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parámetro Studio</a> for luxury real estate developer MONAT.</figcaption></figure></figure>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"></figure>
<p class="p1">In a similar vein, Poland-based 247 Studio looked to the refined serif styles of the early 20th century to inform their identity for coffee brand Pello Caffe.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone">

<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"></figure>
<p class="p1">Art Nouveau style harks back to a period of luxury and &#8220;polite society.&#8221; Portuguese graphic designers Pi Creative Studio translates these values to a modern era with this golden brand design for event brand Synergy.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone">

<p class="p1">Typography is a quick and high-impact way of accessing Art Nouveau style.

<h3 class="p1">2. Art Deco</h3>
<p class="p1">The stylistic reaction to Art Nouveau, <strong>Art Deco</strong> is a <strong>geometric style</strong> that was popular during the 1920s and 1930s. It lifts inspiration from a wide range of influences, including Cubism, Ancient Egyptian art, and the design of transportation. Art Deco is characterized by rich materials and colors, abstract forms and symmetry, and a generally glamorous mood.</p>
<p class="p1">Art Deco is associated with the ‘boom’ period of the 1920s, so it is an oft-revisited vintage design style for makers looking to add a touch of luxury to their projects.</p>
<p class="p1">As with Art Nouveau, typography is a simple way to tap into the Art Deco style. Designer Enrique Presa uses a simplified Deco geometric type in his brand identity for Bo Bom, a gelateria in Palma de Mallorca.</p>

<h3 class="p1">3. Bauhaus</h3>
<p class="p1">The <strong>Bauhaus</strong> movement was developed at the progressive art Bauhaus School in Weimar, Germany in 1919. As with Art Nouveau and Art Deco, the Bauhaus was a &#8220;total&#8221; design style, influencing a wide range of artistic fields, including architecture, graphics, typography, theatre, and furniture.</p>
<p class="p1">With the centenary of the establishment of the Bauhaus falling this year, many contemporary designers are reflecting on the legacy of the German art school, and in the process rediscovering its ever-relevant values of <strong>simplicity</strong>, <strong>functionality</strong> and <strong>modernism</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1">Simple geometric shapes, minimal color palettes, and sans serif typefaces are trademarks of the Bauhaus vintage design style. Here, Lisbon-based agency Musa WorkLab translates these trademarks into an effective brand identity for For Arts Sake (FAS).</p>

<h3 class="p1">4. Mid-Century Modern</h3>
<p class="p1">Inspired by the growing popularity for modernism in Europe, <strong>Mid-Century Modern</strong> developed in America in the 1930s. Coined as Mid-Century Modern (MCM) by writer Cara Greenberg in the 1980s, MCM is recognized as a hugely influential style that inspired interiors, products, architecture, furniture and graphic design from the 1930s until the mid-1960s.</p>
<p class="p1">Especially prevalent in California and Brazil (the latter due to the prolific work of architect Oscar Neimeyer), Mid-Century Modern is celebrated for its characterful approach to modernist design. Graphic designers of the MCM period favored <strong>flat design</strong>, <strong>dynamic shapes</strong> and a joyful, <strong>bold approach to illustration and type</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1">MCM gives designs an inclusive, energetic mood, which makes it the perfect vintage design style for community events. Here, Indonesian designer Mirza P. Wardhana creates a jaunty, MCM-inspired layout for the poster and flyer design for a House of Sale event.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone">

<p class="p1">Inspired by the work of MCM-era designer Saul Bass, this visual identity for an exhibition by Austrian graphic designer Marina Lewandowska uses pastel tones, playfully arranged shapes and Fifties-inspired type.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone">
<p><figure id="attachment_106426"  class="wp-caption alignnone  entry__figure entry__figure--size-large&quot;"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/83166945/Private-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-106426 size-large" title="5 Vintage Design Styles Every Designer Should Know – Mid Century Modern Visual Identity" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/Private-Space.jpg?w=750" alt="mid century modern visual identity" width="750" height="530" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Visual identity for Karolina Balcer’s exhibition ‘Private space’, by <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/83166945/Private-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marina Lewandowska</a>.</figcaption></figure></figure>

<h3 class="p1">5. Psychedelia</h3>
<p class="p1">In the 1960s, youth counterculture discovered a new voice through the psychedelic music of artists like The Beatles. <strong>Psychedelic art</strong> developed alongside this music to visually convey the hallucinogenic style of the songs.</p>
<p class="p1">Posters of the psychedelic era mimicked the effect of hallucinatory drugs like LSD; designs typically featured <strong>whirling shapes</strong>, <strong>intense colors</strong>, and <strong>illusions</strong>. Designers also radically reinterpreted Art Nouveau, blending vintage styles to create an even more mind-bending effect.</p>
<p class="p1">The optimism, energy, and experimental approach of psychedelia has enticed a new generation of designers looking to stand out with vintage design.</p>
<p class="p1">Designer Verena Michelitsch uses warped type and intense colors in these logo and business card designs for Brooklyn-based design practice Jumbo.</p>

<p class="p1">Pizza restaurant Rosa by Martín Azambuja makes a milder nod to 1960s and 1970s psychedelic design. Their brand identity retains the era&#8217;s vivid colors and ballooning typography, but pares back the layout for a contemporary look.</p>

<p>Naive Art is just art made by untrained people. All right, thanks for reading.</p>
<p>Just kidding, it&#8217;s <em>so much more</em> than that. Naiveté in the arts brings us back to the very essence of why we create in the first place.</p>
<p>Put even more simply, Naive art can shake our sensibilities back to our most primal reasons for self expression. Is it even art? Of course it is. It&#8217;s every bit as passionate, and in some ways as skillful, as the stuff we study in textbooks and at museums. You can glean a ton from looking at amateur art and design, too. It&#8217;s like seeing a band that is may not be technically proficient, but is pleasingly ramshackle. Like a lot of creative expressions, music is a whole mix of many different things like emotions, hooks, rhythms, sonic colors, etc., that connect with people, speaking a universally understood language.</p>
<p>The same is true for visual art. Seeing a primitive, hastily made, colorfully cheap illustration on a piece of cardboard can take us away just as a huge, perfect Rothko or Mondrian can.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how Naive Art has influenced design and then you can take the baton and let it inform yours.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What is &#8220;Naive Art?&#8221;</h3>
<figure id="attachment_106273"  class="wp-caption alignnone  entry__figure entry__figure--size-full&quot;"><img class="wp-image-106273 size-full" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/rousseau.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="804" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em style="font-size: 16px">Henri Rousseau, </em><span style="font-size: 16px">Tropical Forest with Apes and Snake</span><em style="font-size: 16px">, 1910, via <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-rousseau/tropical-forest-with-apes-and-snake-1910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wikiart.com</a>, public domain.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&#8217;s a very reductive crash course in the context of &#8220;formal&#8221; <a href="https://www.widewalls.ch/naive-art-movement-artists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naive Art</a>: there is a definitive movement called Naive Art, and arguably the most named-recognized practitioner is Henri Rousseau, who derived it from Post-Impressionism. The Impressionists and Post-Impressionists sought to use light and reductive shapes to create dazzling works of great depth. But, these works were maligned in their day by the fine artists practicing a Rococo style — the grand, gilded, romanticized depictions of idyllic opulence. Many of these artists, like Gaugin, who painted residents of Polynesia in a style that reflected the primitive culture there, were inspired by folk and peasant artists to reduce subjects to a simpler, less formal style.</p>
<p>Naive art can also refer to the generally untrained but intentional style employed by uneducated artists, those with a lot of &#8220;un-&#8221; descriptors, i.e. truly naive. As a general description, The <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/n/naive-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tate Museum&#8217;s website</a> describes it as such:</p>
<blockquote><p>Naïve art is simple, unaffected and unsophisticated — usually specifically refers to art made by artists who have had no formal training in an art school or academy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, we have two frameworks from which we can build a more encompassing take on Naive Art. One is a direct lineage and name for a group of now-recognized artists, and one is a general principle that can describe a<em> lack</em> of style.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106182 size-full" title="Using the Creativity in Naive Art for Your Design Style— Matisse" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock-naive-art-design-inspiration-matissse.jpg" alt="Using the Creativity in Naive Art for Your Design Style — Matisse" width="1024" height="674" /></p>

<p>For the purposes of inspiration, we can pull from either. As the terminology can become more blurred the deeper we dive, it&#8217;s important to note that Folk Art in the modern context can include artists ranging from the intellectually impaired to those intentionally mimicking the art of those who reproduce their naturally unique way of seeing the world. In fact, there is a rich vein of Folk Art displaying the results of some these qualities that can include impairment, handicap, societal position, transience of lifestyle, and cultural inheritance or tradition. As none of these qualities are presented in negative light, we should be respectful of any of these traits and the people who embody them, and act ethically. I sincerely implore you to research the artists you discover when looking to Folk Art or Naive Art, to avoid exploitative inspiration or appropriation of any kind.</p>

<h3>Zines and Doodles: Amateurism in Design</h3>
<p>A major component of what we know as <em><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/design-trends-introduction-zine-culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zine Culture</a></em> is inclusiveness. The explosion of DIY music, culture, and protest zines from the zine heydays of the 1960s-90s meant anyone could viably produce respected artwork. With <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/national-museum-women-arts-zine-exhibit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality content</a> or by a hitting a niche, shared interest, amateurs created their own channels of communication.</p>
<p>Photocopying, rough collage work, ransom note-style cut and paste lettering, and basic doodling became just as worthy <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/5-design-trends-zine-creation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">communication devices</a> as &#8220;professionally&#8221; produced magazines.</p>
<p><a href="https://popculturepuke.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-106155 size-full" title="Using the Creativity in Naive Art for Your Design Style— Zine Culture" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock-zine-culture-intro-popculturepuke.jpg" alt="Using the Creativity in Naive Art for Your Design Style — Zine Culture" width="1024" height="579" /></a></p>
<p><em>Image via popculturepuke.com.</em></p>
<p>Cut to now, as zine culture is being rediscovered and mined for fresh ways to use the naive, amateur styles of illustration, it&#8217;s again being seen as a valid way to design. Clean-schmean. Minimalism-schminimalism. Throw all the rules out the window (except maybe balance and unity, but those are pretty natural anyway, right?)</p>
<p>Now we see this <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/50-free-vector-doodles-and-lettering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doodling</a>, childlike style in all sorts of commercial designs. Straight from the notebook cover to the makers of those notebooks.</p>

<h3>Applying Fresh Naiveté to Design</h3>
<p>With these points of reference to draw from, we can reframe how we both see and filter our world into our own work. The blanket advice would be to just apply your craft in a more rudimentary way, intentionally ignoring art school fussiness or stop adhering to rigid codes.</p>
<p>Looking closer, there are some pretty clear ways to make your illustrations, designs, and layouts more interesting, or at least new to you and those familiar with your work.</p>
<h4>Shift the Perspective</h4>
<p>Flat artwork can do all sorts of cool stuff for your design work. It removes the realistic aspects of the design elements that can be hard to pull off in the first place. A big reason people hate <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/defending-drop-shadow-effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drop shadows</a> is that they attempt an artificial realness. That disconnect between something actually floating and an illustrative reproduction of it gives off a bit of <a href="https://www.strangerdimensions.com/2013/11/25/10-creepy-examples-uncanny-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uncanny valley</a>-ness — just enough discomfort to cause an unwanted reaction.</p>
<p>Perspective shifts also can create, amplify, or change the way a layout presents itself. Proper perspective means reducing the size of objects meant to recede in the background, like in real life. Flat perspective simply moves objects up on the field of vision to mimic depth, but by not varying the size, it is a more intentional way of not trying to directly imitate reality. This makes it <em>interesting</em> because it avoids mimicry.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/easter-illustration-rabbits-eggs-green-foliage-379368340" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-106157 size-full" title="Using the Creativity in Naive Art for Your Design Style — Perspective" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock-naive-art-design-inspiration-easter.jpg" alt="Using the Creativity in Naive Art for Your Design Style — Perspective" width="1024" height="1164" /></a></p>

<h4>Play with Shadows</h4>
<p>The way we treat shadows can also be stylized in a way that is less representative and more interesting by being impressionistic, rather than realistic. Simply by reducing the amount of blur on the edges and reducing the detail in the shadow of the object casting it, we can make shadows illustratively naive, i.e. <em>interesting</em>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-106159 size-full" title="Using the Creativity in Naive Art for Your Design Style — Confetti Design" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock-naive-art-design-inspiration-dots.jpg" alt="Using the Creativity in Naive Art for Your Design Style — Confetti Design" width="1024" height="577" /></p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t look real, nor is it trying to. It looks like a rudimentary and stylized confetti <em>pattern</em>, which is more interesting than a<em> replica</em> of confetti.</p>
<h4>Hand Drawn Character Over Computer Perfection</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;ve looked around the internet in the last several years, you may have noticed that even big global brands have adopted the doodle look. Hand drawing is a valid design style. Now, like everything, the style can get watered down and start looking the same, i.e. &#8220;give it the doodle look,&#8221; but doing your own thing is worth trying.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re trying to get the right wobbliness to a set of colored blocks used for a background on a block of text, draw it and scan it. It will take a fraction of the time to sketch straight from your brain than it would to try to filter it through a mouse, in a design program, on a screen, and then adjust it to what you envision.</p>

<p>Instead of using the computer for everything, draw stuff. Or draw stuff on the computer, whichever. But, don&#8217;t worry about perfection. Develop a personality instead.</p>

<p>Using long exposure in landscape photography is an incredibly popular and beautiful way to capture an image of the great outdoors. Using long exposure techniques in photography can yield a few different types of images including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motion Blur:</strong> Creating a blurry effect to a subject or nature in motion</li>
<li><strong>Light Streaks:</strong> To turn normal lights into long streaks of electric color</li>
<li><strong>Light Painting:</strong> Using a light source to “paint” images within a long exposure</li>
</ul>

<p>Long exposure uses a slow shutter speed to elongate details in an image and create an almost ethereal, magical effect to your images. When creating long exposure landscape photography, popular ways that people use this technique is to create a motion blur in waterfalls, capture light trails by moving cars, and taking images of the stars. However, it can also be used for everyday landscape photography to slow things down, and really capture a sharp and stunning image.</p>
<p>The following twelve tips are some suggestions on how you can get started in long exposure landscape photography, and start creating some of these images for stock.</p>

<h3><strong>Tip #1: Analyze the location you want to capture</strong></h3>
<p>When you initially arrive at a shoot location (especially if it’s a beautiful one), your first instinct may be to start immediately shooting. However, our top tip is to <strong>slow down</strong>. Analyze what equipment and what settings you need. The scene needs to create the effect you want in your images.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center">Shutterstock Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/flowing-clouds-closeup-on-mountains-spectacular-1157210734?src=GBVma14eAOi73nVmJ_dSMA-1-32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighttrain</a></h5>
<p>Where is the sun? When is the light going to be at its optimal shoot point? Is there a defining feature to the scene, such as a waterfall? Ask yourself questions about what the location demands before you start shooting.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, slowing down, and not getting click-crazy is the ultimate way to create images that have a true impact.</p>
<h3>Tip #2: Use ND filters to control the light</h3>
<p><strong>Neutral density (ND) filters</strong> are incredibly useful tools to have when shooting long exposure landscape photography. ND filters allow you to control the amount of light that passes through the lens, giving the photography the best control overexposure.</p>
<p>For photographers wanting to shoot long exposures, this means that you can shoot longer exposures no matter what time of day it is (ie: bright daylight).</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/long-exposure-soft-colorful-sunset-sea-1257652546?src=a4bIIRlPRd0279JFaUjXqA-1-52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106476 size-large" title="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Blurred Ocean" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_1257652546.jpg?w=750" alt="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Blurred Ocean" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>
<h5 style="text-align: center">Shutterstock Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/long-exposure-soft-colorful-sunset-sea-1257652546?src=a4bIIRlPRd0279JFaUjXqA-1-52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pratilop prombud</a></h5>
<h4>ND Filters Explained</h4>
<p>Each stop of an ND filter reduces the amount of light entering the camera by a factor of two. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 stop = 2 = ND2</li>
<li>2 stops = 2 x 2 = ND4</li>
<li>3 stops = 2 x 2 x 2 = ND8</li>
</ul>
<p>This continues the more stops you have on your filter, and can greatly support you in creating long exposure landscape photographs during the day by controlling the light.</p>
<h3>Tip #3: A tripod is key for long exposure landscape photography</h3>
<p>We’ve already discussed the first must-have gear for long exposures (ND filters), and this tool pairs with the ND filters to create great long exposures. <strong>That must-have piece of gear is a tripod.</strong> A tripod is a must-have for shooting great, stable long exposures. While you can absolutely prop your camera on a rock or tree stump in a pinch, a tripod is the ultimate piece of equipment for capturing long exposures.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/night-camping-couple-tourists-sitting-campfire-675062977?src=G3Me7t3KNUOmWaaINDQmFQ-1-98" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106477 size-large" title="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Camping with Stars" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_675062977.jpg?w=750" alt="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Camping with Stars" width="750" height="422" /></a></figure>
<h5 style="text-align: center">Shutterstock Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/night-camping-couple-tourists-sitting-campfire-675062977?src=G3Me7t3KNUOmWaaINDQmFQ-1-98" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anatolliy_gleb</a></h5>
<p>Basically, the more stable of a tripod or supporting surface for your camera, the sharper your image will be and the slower you can slow down your shutter to capture long exposures.</p>
<h3>Tip #4: Frame your image before putting on the filter</h3>
<p>An ND filter can make it really challenging to focus with, as it really limits the amount of light getting through. We suggest composing your image and setting your focus <strong>before you shoot</strong> to allow you the best chance of capturing the image you want. After you’ve focused and composed your image, switch your camera to manual focus and attach the ND filter. This removes the lens capability to adjust the focus once the filter is on.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/white-romantic-pier-on-water-real-1305602605?src=U2cXoEeDJ3yzSegLJBJ0Ww-2-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106478 size-large" title="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Boardwalk at Sunrise" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_1305602605.jpg?w=750" alt="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Boardwalk at Sunrise" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>
<h5 style="text-align: center">Shutterstock Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/white-romantic-pier-on-water-real-1305602605?src=U2cXoEeDJ3yzSegLJBJ0Ww-2-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taiga</a></h5>
<p>Once you’ve added your filter, you’ll need to recalculate the correct exposure for the ND filter you added. For example, if you exposed an image without a filter at f/4, 1/200 and ISO 100, and you added an ND4 filter, you’ll need to remove two stops of light. That image with an ND filter could be shot at f/3.2, 1/200 and ISO 100.</p>
<p>If you move your tripod or want to compose an alternative shot, however, you will need to remove the filter and re-adjust your focus and composition before putting the filter back on.</p>
<h3>Tip #5: Use a remote shutter release cable (or self-timer)</h3>
<p>Using a remote shutter release cable that links to your camera on a tripod is the quickest and easiest way to capture long exposures. By using a shutter release cable, you limit any opportunity for camera shake and for the image to be unfocused.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/abstract-blurred-ocean-background-black-white-720219430?src=a4bIIRlPRd0279JFaUjXqA-4-42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106479 size-large" title="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Black and White Waves" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_720219430.jpg?w=750" alt="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Black and White Waves" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>
<h5 style="text-align: center">Shutterstock Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/abstract-blurred-ocean-background-black-white-720219430?src=a4bIIRlPRd0279JFaUjXqA-4-42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judah Grubb</a></h5>
<p>Alternatively, if you don’t have a remote shutter release cable, you can use the camera’s self-timer to set the shutter and then step back and limit camera shake. <strong>Cameras typically have a two-second and ten-second timer.</strong> When possible, we suggest using the ten-second timer to have the lowest opportunity for camera shake.</p>
<h3>Tip #6: Keep your ISO low</h3>
<p>With a tripod and a slower shutter speed, in most cases, you should be able to keep your ISO low while shooting. This limits the amount of noise in your image and creates the sharpest long exposure possible. There are not many cases where you have the opportunity to keep your ISO low, but shooting long exposures (especially during the day) is one of them.</p>
<h3>Tip #7: Shooting general landscapes? Look for wind</h3>
<p>Choosing the right conditions for the environment you’d like to shoot in is necessary when shooting long exposures. If you don’t have a focal point with movement such as a waterfall, you will just be shooting a typical landscape image.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/that-wanaka-tree-sunrise-new-zealand-1028852338?src=ndHM8_8B16jtx-_jjq-yfw-1-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106492 size-large" title="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Wanaka Tree" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_1028852338.jpg?w=750" alt="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Wanaka Tree" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>
<h5 style="text-align: center">Shutterstock Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/that-wanaka-tree-sunrise-new-zealand-1028852338?src=ndHM8_8B16jtx-_jjq-yfw-1-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winston Tan</a></h5>
<p>To create a long exposure out of a classic landscape, such as a field <strong>look for clouds and wind.</strong> Spotty clouds and wind create motion in the sky and allow the viewer to see a difference in your long exposure image. The same can also be said for wheat or tall grass moving in the wind, or waves on the ocean. Wind creates motion in an image, which is key for long exposure landscape photography.</p>
<h3>Tip #8: Interested in shooting stars and light trails? Look for a clear night</h3>
<p>If you have a keen interest in shooting stars and epic images of the milky way, you need to wait for a clear night, without clouds. The clearer the sky, the better the chance of seeing stars. Look for interesting and dynamic outdoor locations that can offer foregrounds to your images, such as trees or mountains.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/milky-way-over-desert-bardenas-spain-89879314?src=Y9YSp_8J0XVR3u898KQsfw-1-95#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106480 size-large" title="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Milky Way in Desert" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_89879314.jpg?w=750" alt="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Milky Way in Desert" width="750" height="1083" /></a></figure>
<h5 style="text-align: center">Shutterstock Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/milky-way-over-desert-bardenas-spain-89879314?src=Y9YSp_8J0XVR3u898KQsfw-1-95#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inigocia</a></h5>
<p>Once you find the right spot, set your camera up. For typical images of stars in the sky or milky way, you’ll want your exposure to just a few seconds (fifteen should work most of the time), and adjust your aperture from there while limiting the ISO you need to increase.</p>
<h4>Shooting Star Trails</h4>
<p><strong>To shoot images of star trails,</strong> you’ll need to use a significantly slower shutter speed. In most situations, an exposure between thirty minutes to an hour would be enough to produce streaks. The longer the shutter is open, the longer the trails. Make sure your camera is charged and that you have a stable tripod or surface if shooting light trails is your goal.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/vortex-night-exposure-star-trails-sky-246640954?src=8eAs7AN0GrUK_kBSaAfuDA-1-50" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106486 size-large" title="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Star Trails" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_246640954.jpg?w=750" alt="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Star Trails" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>

<h4>Locating the North Star</h4>
<p>To create a circular pattern to your light trails, you’ll need to locate the North Star as a focal point to set your composition and focus. Use an app such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PYOPYO.StarTracker&amp;hl=en_CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Tracker</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid&amp;hl=en_CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sky Map</a> to find it by pointing your camera to the sky and start searching.</p>
<h3>Tip #9: Want to shoot light streaks? Find a busy street</h3>
<p>We get it. Not everyone has access to the great outdoors. But <strong>long exposure landscape photography can be done in the city too</strong>. Light streaks (or trails) can come from the taillights and headlights of passing vehicles on a busy street. Find a place that has a lot of traffic, and an interesting composition (such as a raised bridge). Your shutter speed should be between five and twenty seconds, depending on how much ambient light is available.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/birdseye-view-city-interchange-bird-335086088?src=U2cXoEeDJ3yzSegLJBJ0Ww-1-71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106481 size-large" title="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Light Trails" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_335086088-e1565805429512.jpg?w=750" alt="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Light Trails" width="750" height="450" /></a></figure>

<h3>Tip #10: How to light paint</h3>
<p>Another great way you can shoot long exposures in an urban city or nature is to create a light painting effect within your long exposure frame. This may require the assistance of a friend, or a really good wireless remote. The only other thing you need is an additional light source, such as a flashlight or a sparkler.</p>
<p>Start by taking a test shot without the additional light source to set the exposure of the light available. Expose the image a little on the darker side as you’ll be putting an extra light source in the frame. Your shutter speed should be at least thirty seconds to allow you to get into the scene and light the subject.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/love-light-painting-211358305?src=G3QK23i4l252xTUZI03cxQ-2-49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106490 size-large" title="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Light Painting" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_211358305.jpg?w=750" alt="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Light Painting" width="750" height="499" /></a></figure>
<h5 style="text-align: center">Shutterstock Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/love-light-painting-211358305?src=G3QK23i4l252xTUZI03cxQ-2-49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elly Photography</a></h5>
<p>Whoever is in the scene with the light should be wearing dark clothing and keep moving throughout the shot so that they don’t show up in focus. Aim the light source at the subject or landscape you want to paint on, not at the camera. Keep the light moving, and practice different techniques. Try to light words, or create hearts and other shapes to start.</p>
<h3>Tip #11: How to photograph long exposures with moving water</h3>
<p><strong>There’s nothing more soothing than a silky, smooth flowing waterfall.</strong> Or, motion frozen in time from a passing surfer on a massive wave. These striking images create a magical feel to any photograph. When shooting with water, think of what direction the water is flowing and give it room within your frame. Using the rule of thirds, compose your image to generate interest within the frame along with those points.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-waterfall-slow-shutter-giving-glass-34834615?src=U2cXoEeDJ3yzSegLJBJ0Ww-2-85" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106483 size-large" title="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Black and White Waterfall" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_34834615.jpg?w=750" alt="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Black and White Waterfall" width="750" height="1020" /></a></figure>
<h5 style="text-align: center">Shutterstock Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-waterfall-slow-shutter-giving-glass-34834615?src=U2cXoEeDJ3yzSegLJBJ0Ww-2-85" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Gubbins</a></h5>
<p>Shutter speed will greatly affect the look you&#8217;re after, and your settings depend on how fast water is flowing. We suggest starting at five seconds and adjust from there depending on the amount of light available and what your ideal aperture is.</p>
<h4>Long Exposures with Subjects in Water</h4>
<p>When you&#8217;re not photographing rivers or waterfalls and maybe want to try long exposures of subjects in water (such as surfers or an underwater salmon), start with a slightly faster shutter speed as you may want the surfer or fish in the frame to be more focused. We suggest starting at 1/10 and adjusting from there depending on how fast the subject moves within the water or frame.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/surfing-motion-blur-61590166?src=27bUM-jnPcewpFF76Z_5zg-1-18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106484 size-large" title="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Surfer in Water" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_61590166.jpg?w=750" alt="12 Tips to Master Long Exposure Landscape Photography — Surfer in Water" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>

<h3>Tip #12: Patience is key in long exposure landscape photography</h3>
<p><strong>“Landscape photography is the supreme test of the photographer—and often the supreme disappointment,” said the great Ansel Adams.</strong> Landscape photography can be challenging. Creating a unique image that isn’t just a captured landscape requires patience, research, and passion. Lighting makes a huge difference in landscape photography, and waiting for the right light is absolutely key in long exposures.</p>
<h4>Night Long Exposures</h4>
<p>Don’t rush when you’re shooting long exposures. When it comes to night photography, wait until you know where the stars you want to shoot are in the sky. Apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/star-tracker-lite-live-sky-map/id780172278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Tracker</a> are great for telling you exactly when and where to expect your favorite stars.</p>

<h4>Daylight long exposures</h4>
<p>In daylight long exposure landscape photography, waiting for the right wind and where the sun is going to be is pivotal to creating the ideal image. Apps such as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/sun-seeker-tracker-compass/id330247123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sun Seeker</a> are comprehensive ways to see exactly where the sun is going to be at any time of the day, no matter where you are in the world.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s truly nothing like golden hour. Aside from the stunning images this time of day produces, even just walking around during golden hour makes you feel like you&#8217;re in a movie. While some of the aspects of this unique window of time are indescribable, there are a few defining characteristics that we can break down into a science. So, that being said, let&#8217;s take a look at how to take advantage of golden hour in every way possible to capture the perfect image.</p>

<h3>Be Safe with Longer Lenses</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-106538" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/Long-Lens.jpg?w=750" alt="" width="750" height="356" /></p>
<p>One of the first things you might hear from any videographer or photographer is the importance of a wide lens. Well, they&#8217;re not wrong. You should always have some type of wide lens, from 24-50 mm, so you can feature as much as possible. Because the sun is so low, almost touching the horizon, you&#8217;re going to get super long shadows everywhere. This helps your images look more dynamic, and it yields a softer, less-contrasted shot.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-106539" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/Shadows.jpg?w=750" alt="" width="750" height="380" /></p>
<p>However, I&#8217;ve often found that you&#8217;ll accidentally get your shadow in the shot, specifically if you&#8217;re facing away from the sun. There have even been times when I didn&#8217;t realize my shadow was in the shot till later on in the editing process, and I pretty much wanted to throw my computer out the window. So, be sure to keep everything 50mm and longer, just to be safe.</p>
<h3>Bring a Reflector for Portraits</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-106536" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/Reflector.jpg?w=750" alt="" width="750" height="350" /></p>
<p>One thing about golden hour that gets misconstrued is that the magical warm, tungsten-y light is all you&#8217;ll need for your shoot. Often, you just want to run out into the field or near a cool-looking building and just start firing away. Well, the problem is that the sun is super directional, meaning many areas around you will be in the shade — specifically anything facing away from the sun. So for your next portrait shoot, make sure if your model is facing away from the sun that you bring some kind of reflector to bounce light back up on the side of their face. You can use white cardboard or an actual reflector; just make sure the color temperature matches the rest of the light in the shot.</p>
<h3>Try Shooting Interiors with a Tripod</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-106541" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/interior-golden-hour.jpg?w=750" alt="" width="750" height="389" /></p>
<p><em>Image via <a href="https://premier.shutterstock.com/image/detail-1237853677/small-decorative-greenhouse-with-cacti-at-home-during-sunset-selective-focus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jelena990</a>.</em></p>
<p>When you think of golden hour, you think of the outdoors. The warm 3500k light hitting all the leaves and grass, illuminating your surroundings cinematically. But, one aspect of golden hour that you should also explore is the lighting it creates inside buildings. As with the outdoors, the warm light can create some truly stunning imagery. This is a style of photography that I need to try more often.</p>
<p>Taking photos indoors is not something that comes naturally to most photographers, so I&#8217;d recommend keeping a tripod on hand. Even if you&#8217;re shooting at 1/60th shutter speed, there will be darker parts of the house that are in complete shadow, so exposure might be a little tricky at first. It&#8217;s better to be safe if you&#8217;re shooting in a building you&#8217;re not familiar with. So, experiment a little with over-exposing by a stop or two just to get your bearings right.</p>
<h3>Turn Around</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-106540" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/Face-away-from-Light.jpg?w=750" alt="" width="750" height="390" /></p>
<p>Okay stay with me. This might sound too simple, and it is. Once the sun has started to set, you really can&#8217;t help but aim your camera at the fireball in the sky, capturing those sweet lens flare effects as the warm light on your lens creates that iconic cinematic effect that we all know and love. But while properly exposing one of those shots can be tricky, it&#8217;s important to note that everything that golden hour light touches is giving you absolute gold.</p>
<p>The oranges and pinks and reds are not something you can create in Lightroom. So turn your back to the sun and start shooting.</p>
<h3>Scout Beforehand — You Really Have No Time</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-106537" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/Time-of-Day.jpg?w=750" alt="" width="750" height="396" /></p>
<p>Judging how long golden hour will last is pretty simple. There are many apps you can use, and almost all of them are pretty accurate. The hard part is making good use of the time. So there are a couple of things I like to do beforehand. First, I scout my location. This is something everyone should be doing before any shoot (especially if you&#8217;re getting paid). I also try to arrive an hour before golden hour. Even if your app tells you that it starts at 6:30, the good light for you might start at 6. You don&#8217;t have to shoot only <em>exactly</em> at golden hour. If the light looks good, shoot!</p>

<p><strong>Travel photos don’t have to be boring.</strong> Capturing unique travel photos that are worthy of sharing on social media can be easy, as long as you&#8217;re curious and creative, willing to research, and open to exploring new vantage points.</p>
<p>We’re not talking about classic Santorini white-cliff images, taken from the same spot with a thousand other tourists around you. <strong>We’re talking about putting your explorer hat on, and getting creative.</strong> Take it from me. I travel a lot. At any given time you’ll find me on a plane, waiting for a ferry, or on a road trip across the country.</p>
<p>A sense of exploration is key to capturing unique travel photos that tell a true story of a place, rather than a checkmark on a list of photo locations you need to capture.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>5 Tips on Taking Unique Travel Photos</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Tip #1: A good travel photo begins with good travel research</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you prefer to open a book and research an up-and-coming destination or take to your Internet browser- <strong>sourcing shoot locations for unique travel photos starts with research</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s say for example your traveling to Bali, Indonesia. Rather than simply searching “Bali photo spots” which is absolutely going to give you the top photo spots in the world (that millions of people have photographed), consider a slightly more tailored approach.</p>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-large alignnone"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/woman-bikini-enjoying-waterfall-jungle-enjoyingwaterfall-1417219121?src=UBdRhn_HnzNX34ylSX4YZQ-1-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106367 size-large" title="Five Professional Tips for Taking Unique Travel Photos — Girl in Waterfall in Bali" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/shutterstock_1417219121.jpg?w=750" alt="Five Professional Tips for Taking Unique Travel Photos — Girl in Waterfall in Bali" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/woman-bikini-enjoying-waterfall-jungle-enjoyingwaterfall-1417219121?src=UBdRhn_HnzNX34ylSX4YZQ-1-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterfall in Bali</a> by PhotoSunny</h5>
<p>Start by searching “Bali travel blogs” and “Unique things to do in Bali.” These might not necessarily be photo spots right off the bat. However, they are going to have first-person traveler experience at going to unique spots in Bali. <strong>Travel blogs are fantastic for photo research</strong>, especially if the blog is written by a photographer, as these typically will have stronger, more Instagram-friendly photo locations that are unique from what you’ll find on Google.</p>
<h4><strong>Social media is your best friend for photo research</strong></h4>
<p>Rather than just searching online, try opening Instagram. <strong>Instagram is the ultimate tool for photo research.</strong> Find a local photographer that looks inspiring and research some of their past shoot locations.</p>
<p>Now, we’re <strong>not</strong> talking about taking their photos and copying them. Use other artists imagery for inspiration, and find your own approach.</p>
<p>To find a local photographer to get inspired by, our top tip is to find a location-based feature account (such as <a href="http://www.instagram.com/hellobc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@HelloBC</a> in British Columbia, Canada) and look at who they are following and featuring. Chances are, they will be local photographers who capture unique photos in their location and who can be a great source for inspiration for your own photo ideas.</p>

<h3><strong>Tip #2: Walk around (when possible)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The best way to find unique photo spots is to walk</strong>, not drive, around a location you find interesting. Find an interesting spot on the map where it looks like a lot of art galleries, restaurants, and shopping might exist (if you’re traveling in a city). If you prefer the outdoors, find a cool lake by expanding your maps to look for bodies of water.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found your location, walk around. By walking, you get to see so much more than if you drove. Search for little photo cues such as colorful walls, hidden alleyways, or adorable storefronts when wandering a city. In nature, look for trees that frame nature, a reflection in a lake, or if you’re lucky, a glimpse at wildlife. <strong>Walking allows you so much more opportunity to capture unique travel photos.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Tip #3: Capture intimate details, not just wide landscapes</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Intimate details are what makes a place and a moment truly unique.</strong> You may have explored the Eiffel Tower a million times, capturing it from all angles. But did you ever look at the people around the tower? A picnic in the park, with just a mere glimpse of the tower behind. A cat glimpsing out the window of a nearby Parisian apartment. Bunches of flowers lined outside the local market.</p>
<p>Capturing details and unique angles that may not have received photographic attention is a lot more interesting than your classic postcard shot.</p>

<h3><strong>Tip #4: Ignore the cliche shots. Create unique moments instead</strong></h3>
<p>Your travel photos should be raw and honest memories of your true experience of a destination. If you’re traveling with friends, instead of having them set up in front of a famous monument and smile, capture them in motion. Capture images from behind of their feet traveling across a bricked walkway in London. A top-down image of food with a few hands reaching in to devour an amazing table of Mediterranean mezze. Or, a glimpse of your best friend over her shoulder as she walks towards the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>These are the moments worth sharing, and the real, raw, and authentic travel photos that <em>are</em> selling on stock.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Tip #5: Get outside your comfort zone and approach a local</strong></h3>
<p>Locals are the ultimate resource for the best knowledge of any given area. Form <strong>meaningful connections and relationships</strong> with the locals of the destinations you visit. It can be as simple as a conversation with your waiter, a street artist working on a mural, or a busker playing his guitar. Locals have the best knowledge of what’s cool and interesting in their area. Capturing local people in your images is a further way to show a true representation of place through your images.</p>

<h4><strong>Taking portraits while traveling</strong></h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re traveling somewhere unique and have the opportunity to take portraits of local people, approach respectfully and kindly ask to capture their images. Express gratitude and if the moment fits, consider asking them to <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/model-release-every-shoot-complete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign a model release</a> and submit the image to <a href="https://submit.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shutterstock</a>. Images of local people doing everyday tasks are the kind of unique travel photos that clients look for on Shutterstock.</p>
<p>We hope these tips help you capture a unique travel photo the next time you travel to any popular destination around the world. The most important thing when capturing travel imagery is to <strong>show a true and honest, authentic representation of that destination</strong>. Capture local food, local people, and local architecture with unique and diverse angles to make memories worth sharing. We can’t wait to see what you create next on <a href="https://submit.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shutterstock</a>.</p>

<p>As the fifth largest country in the world, Brazil hosts an astonishing array of natural wonders. The nation is home to our planet’s largest tropical wetland (the Pantanal), rainforest (the Amazon), and watershed (the Amazon River). It has the greatest variety of wildlife on the globe, with residents as diverse as the giant anaconda, the capybara, and the piranha.</p>
<p>Despite its awe-inspiring beauty, only seven percent of Brazil’s land is protected as part of a national park. Deforestation has devastated some of its most vibrant locations, accelerating climate change worldwide. Precious mammals, including the black-faced and golden-rumped lion tamarin, the jaguar, the ring-tail monkey, and many others face the threat of extinction, while acid rain is responsible for killing some of the nation’s most extraordinary fish.</p>
<p>Brazil’s landscapes are stunning to behold, but beyond that, they are vital to our future. We asked ten photographers from this spectacular part of the world to tell us about some of the scenes they’ve witnessed while exploring its vast terrain. Read on for tales from just a few of the cities, national parks, and hidden alcoves that make this country so special.</p>

<p>I was sent to Gonçalves in the state of Minas Gerais to do a story for <em>Revista Gol</em>, the magazine belonging to the Brazilian airline Gol. It was a warm summer afternoon, and the sun was just beginning to set.</p>
<p>The journalist Luís Patriani and I were traveling by car in the middle of these fields when we saw this gorgeous white horse over a hill. I asked him to stop the car, and we both climbed the fence. We contemplated this beautiful animal for several minutes before going on our way.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong></p>
<p>All travel photography requires patience. Take your time finding the right spot, and wait for the perfect moment to press the shutter. Of course, you also need some luck. The best way to have “luck” on your side is to interact with local people. Ask: Where do you usually go to eat, and what you eat there? On the weekends, where do you chill with your friends? These simple tips will make your experience richer, more real, and more unique.</p>

<p><em>Image by ​<a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/g/fredcardoso" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Cardoso</a></em>​. ​<strong>Gear:</strong> Canon EOS 600D camera, Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II lens. <strong>Settings:</strong> Focal length 48mm; exposure 1/100 sec; f/9; ISO 100.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the story behind this photo?​</strong></p>
<p>I took a job in the state of Mato Grosso in the midwest of Brazil. The city where I was staying wasn’t far from Chapada dos Guimarães, so my wife and I decided to visit the national park for the weekend.</p>
<p>This place is amazing! It is full of exotic animals, ​<a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/waterfall-veu-da-noiva-chapada-dos-286914800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfalls</a>​, caves, and unusual rock formations, like the one in this picture. When we arrived at this particular place, called “stone city,” we were astonished.</p>
<p>At first, shooting was a bit frustrating because the weather was completely cloudy, and the shadows made the scenery look dull. In the end, we decided to move on to a different viewpoint a bit further ahead.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the clouds spread apart, allowing some rays of light to breathe life into the photo. We still had plenty of places to see in the park, but we ended up standing there for a long time—just admiring the stone city.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong></p>
<p>Brazil is a huge, diverse country, so my best tip is to research the conditions of your chosen locations before visiting them. Travel blogs, local websites, and local guides are all good sources for up-to-date information.</p>
<p>There are incredible up-country locations that are not as popular or tourist-heavy as you’d expect. You can explore these areas with the help of local guides, who will take you to the most interesting spots for a reasonable price. National park websites often provide information about accredited guides you can contact.</p>

<h3>3. &#8220;If you want to find those true “hidden gems,” don’t be afraid to hire a private guide.&#8221;</h3>
<h4>Vitor Schietti</h4>
<figure class="entry__figure entry__figure--size-full alignnone"><a href="https://www.offset.com/photos/regrowth-of-purple-flowers-growing-in-brazil-after-a-wildfire-396221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-106163 size-full" title="10 Landscape Photographers on Capturing the Beauty of Brazil — Private Guides" src="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/2-3.jpg" alt="10 Landscape Photographers on Capturing the Beauty of Brazil — Private Guides" width="750" height="500" /></a></figure>
<p><em>Image by ​<a href="https://www.offset.com/artist/Vitor+Schietti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vitor Schietti</a></em>​. <strong>Gear:</strong> ​Canon 5D Mark III​ camera, ​Canon EF 24-70 mm F2.8 L USM lens. <strong>Settings:</strong> Focal length 54mm; exposure 1/60 sec; f7.1; ISO ​200​.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the story behind this photo?</strong></p>
<p>In late 2014 and early 2015, I embarked on a month-long road trip to the state of Bahia. I enjoyed a paradisiac beach town called Caraíva, rock climbed the Yosemite-like topography of Itatim, and hiked in Chapada Diamantina, where this picture was taken.</p>
<p>The story behind this picture is poetic but also sad: these purple flowers, blooming as far as the eye could see, are the aftermath after a devastating fire. The local vegetation is prepared for wildfires, but only as a natural cycle of renovation every two or three years.</p>
<p>Human activity—particularly the abuse of fire as a tool to create land for cattle and soy plantations—threatens the existence of this landscape. This scenario is becoming more and more common in Brazil, especially under the current government.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong></p>
<p>Brazil is immense, almost the size of the entire European continent, so it’s impossible to come up with one general “rule” for photographing its many landscapes. I’ve lived in Brazil for twenty-eight of my thirty-three years, and I’ve been to over half of its states.</p>
<p>Brazilians are very welcoming to foreigners. It always helps if you can move beyond the stereotypes and typical tourist events and locations. Make an effort to learn some Portuguese, and you’ll be able to open even more doors. Make sure you try the traditional foods, as they vary from region to region.</p>
<p>If you want to find those true “hidden gems,” don’t be afraid to hire a private guide. They can take you to places regular tourists don’t have access to. Some of these places are only accessible by 4&#215;4 cars, but you can still visit a lot of amazing landscapes without one. I took this picture, for example, on a well-known path to one of the tallest waterfalls of the region.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the story behind this photo?​</strong></p>
<p>I took this photo in January of 2014 on one of my vacations with my wife to the coast of Alagoas and Pernambuco. I like to travel, so I frequently organize trips to different regions throughout Brazil and around the world.</p>
<p>So far, I have been to more than twenty-five countries across five continents. Still, this place stood out. It’s a very special part of a city in Pernambuco called Porto de Galinhas, and it is full of reefs.</p>
<p>As this is a tourist town, I paid for a jangadeiro (Boat Man) to take us to a deserted spot. After an hour of rafting, we arrived at this wonderful place. We were alone, with no one else in sight.</p>
<p>The model was my wife, and this photo was both a souvenir from that trip and a way of offsetting the cost of the journey. I always try to produce pictures that generate sales and help pay for my trips.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong></p>
<p>​My tip is to look for out-of-the-way places that haven’t been explored too much. These locations have greater sales potential. Cover different themes, too. Photograph nature, gastronomy, people, architecture, etc. For landscape photography, in particular, I also recommend using a polarizing filter.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the story behind this photo?</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to convey the magnitude of Iguazu Falls in the South of Brazil. This aerial photo shows the vast landscape in relation to the tourists who were there admiring the famous Devil&#8217;s Throat cliff. It’s no wonder this spectacle of nature was elected to be one of the New Seven Wonders of Nature in 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong></p>
<p>Every time I travel to a different country, I ask people: “What comes to your mind when you think of Brazil?&#8221; They quickly respond, “Rio de Janeiro.” But there are other amazing places throughout Brazil, including Iguazu Falls. With a little research, you can find these incredible, wild landscapes.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the story behind this photo?</strong></p>
<p>​I traveled to Lençóis Maranhenses National Park in Maranhão State as part of a field trip for a conservation project. It was the first time I&#8217;d ever been to this special and unique place, where you’ll find these amazing freshwater lakes in the middle of huge and continuous sand dunes. It&#8217;s a wonderful environment for hiking, contemplation, and, of course, landscape photography.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong></p>
<p>Brazil is a huge and highly diverse country, so my main tip is this: don&#8217;t try to see and photograph everything in just one trip. Choose your subjects wisely, connect with locals, and stay as long as you can in the places you visit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to photograph the obvious. But often, the best and most innovative opportunities depend on the local guides. Especially in the Amazon, do not go into the forest without a good local guide. These are the areas where you’ll discover the deep connection between the natural world and traditional cultures.</p>

<p><em>Image by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/g/celsodiniz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">​Celso Diniz</a>​</em>. <strong>Gear:</strong> ​Nikon D700​ camera, ​Nikon 24-120 MM F/4.0​ lens. <strong>Settings:</strong> Focal length 24mm; exposure ​1/200​ sec; f8; ISO 200.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the story behind this photo?</strong></p>
<p>This is a picture of the Botafogo Beach in Rio de Janeiro, showing the statue of Christ the Redeemer on the horizon. I took it from the top of Sugarloaf Mountain, so it’s like three postcards of Rio de Janeiro in the same image.</p>
<p>I also included some vegetation to help frame the picture, including the two jackfruits hanging on the tree. It’s very representative of how nature works in a tropical place like this. The vegetation, the sea, and the mountains come together, and the city sits in the middle of it all.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in Miami for many years now, but I was born in Rio de Janeiro and have always been attracted to the beauty of this city. I took it for granted while living in Rio, but after many years abroad, I visited my family on this gorgeous day. Going up Sugarloaf Mountain brought back all those memories of my childhood: the fantastic sunsets, smells, and noises.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong></p>
<p>Do your homework. Use Google Earth and Google Images to scout your locations, and check Instagram as well. Make sure you track the exact times of sunrises and sunsets. It sounds cliché, but the same exact position won’t look the same at noon, no matter what you do.</p>

<p>This photo is part of my ​<a href="https://www.uiler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long term project​</a> about All Saints Bay, located in Salvador, Bahia, my hometown. I am fascinated by aerial seascapes and landscapes, and the northeast of Brazil has awesome places to photograph nature at its best. I often hire a helicopter and fly over the bay to photograph.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong></p>
<p>​As the light here can change quickly, I would suggest carefully planning your shoot. Try to be at your location at least an hour before you want to take photos. Aim for the golden or blue hour, if possible. Use an app like <a href="https://www.photopills.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">​PhotoPills</a>​ or ​<a href="https://www.photoephemeris.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Photographer&#8217;s Ephemeris</a>​ to check how the light will behave once you’re there. If you have an opportunity to fly over the coast, look for the low tide and a clear sky. Enjoy the moment!</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to landscape photography, light is the most important thing. Brazil is full of beautiful places, but if the light is not good, the photo won’t be spectacular. Try to be at location during sunrise and sunset. The time of day makes all the difference.</p>
